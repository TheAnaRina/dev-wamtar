- The CA only applies to *your original contributions*, not works submitted under an approved license or other negotiated license.
- You have a legal right to attribution (moral rights) in the credits of the project, please tell us if you wish to opt out of being displayed in the credits or wish to use an alternative name.

- The CLA may be amended with 30 days of notice by email. *If you do not agree to the new CLA your contributions will be kept under the old version.*

# Licensing/Attribution:
- Unless specified otherwise, all Assets, Code, or Content inside any _AlphaParadox folder, fall under the terms specified in AP-LICENSE.txt and the [Space Kobold Games CLA](https://gist.github.com/SpaceKoboldGames/a8f6b7a7d272cf949c60e0822cdf226e.

# Approved licenses:
The following licenses are permitted to be used in this project if you are not the original copyright owner:
- The following Creative Commons 4.0 (or later) licenses: [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en), [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode.en), CC-[BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode.en),(ND licenses are discouraged, but accepted) or an earlier version with *permission from the author*.
- [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/MIT)
- [Mozilla Public License v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/) *with* Exhibit B (No secondary licenses)
- Public domain content under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), etc. NOTE: The absence of a copyright mark means **all rights reserved** *not* public domain, public domain must be explicitly marked/stated. Attribution is still required for public domain works.
### Specifically not allowed:
- Any "strong" Copyleft or GPL derivative licenses: GPL, AGPL, LGPL, SSPL, etc. (This conflicts with the no secondary license provision of the MPL)
- Any license with strict or ambiguous non-commercial use limitations.

**We are in the process of removing/replacing content that is currently not under an approved license.**

# Attribution/Sourcing Requirements:
- All assets *must* be properly licensed, attributed, and include the original title of the work. This also requires a link to the original author, and license and if needed provides a way to contact the author.
- For audio files especially: **you must find the actual author not just a YouTube channel**. <u>If you cannot find the author/original license you cannot use the asset.</u> Failure to be able to provide sourcing information will result in your PR being closed and potentially barring from future contributions depending on the severity of the situation.
- License versioning is important, make sure to include the correct version of the license in your attribution. If a version is not specified by the author with a versioned license, that is not a valid license and cannot be used.
- Most Assets have their license and the copyright in the metadata file. [Example](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/blob/master/Resources/Textures/Objects/Tools/crowbar.rsi/meta.json).
- "No Derivatives" licenses should be avoided if possible (but are permitted) as they can prevent fixing bugs or making for accessibility reasons (Color blindness or epilepsy fixes, etc.).
